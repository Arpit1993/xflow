Hi there! My name is Arpit J Soni.


Steps: 

1.) Please do npm install so that the dependencies are installed.

2.) After dependencies are installed, please run the command "npm run dev". 

3.) After you run the "npm run dev" command, a new tab in your browser would be opened with the UI. 




I've used node v14.16.1. 

Note 1: I've added screenshots of the output in the 'Screenshots' folder.

2:  This project has been implemented in two ways first is using localStorage and the second is using React Hooks.

3: To run and check the React Hooks flow please replace the "entry" value in "webpack.config.js" with "./app_global/index.js"

4: You can reach me at 'miliyearpitse@gmail.com' or call 9742954536 for any further queries.




Thank You!
